## Tibber Invitation link

###### Advertisement / Werbung

If you want to join Tibber (become a customer), you might want to use my personal invitation link. When you use this link, Tibber will we grant you and me a bonus of 50,-â‚¬ for each of us. This bonus then can be used in the Tibber store (not for your power bill) - e.g. to buy a Tibber Bridge. I am fully aware, that when you are here in this repository the chances are very high, that you are already a Tibber customer and have already a Tibber Pulse. If you are already a Tibber customer and have not used an invitation link yet, you can also enter one afterward in the Tibber App (up to 14 days). [[see official Tibber support article](https://support.tibber.com/en/articles/4601431-tibber-referral-bonus#h_ae8df266c0)]

Please consider [using my personal Tibber invitation link to join Tibber today](https://invite.tibber.com/6o0kqvzf) or Enter the following code: 6o0kqvzf (six, oscar, zero, kilo, quebec, victor, zulu, foxtrot) afterward in the Tibber App - TIA!
