## Tibber Invitation link

###### Advertisement / Werbung

If you want to join Tibber (become a customer), you might want to use my personal invitation link. When you use this link, Tibber will we grant you and me a bonus of 50,-â‚¬ for each of us. This bonus then can be used in the Tibber store (not for your power bill) - e.g. to buy a Tibber Bridge. I am fully aware, that when you are here in this repository the chances are very high, that you are already a Tibber customer and have already a Tibber Pulse. If you are already a Tibber customer and have not used an invitation link yet, you can also enter one afterward in the Tibber App (up to 14 days). [[see official Tibber support article](https://support.tibber.com/en/articles/4601431-tibber-referral-bonus#h_ae8df266c0)]

Please consider [using my personal Tibber invitation link to join Tibber today](https://invite.tibber.com/6o0kqvzf) or Enter the following code: 6o0kqvzf (six, oscar, zero, kilo, quebec, victor, zulu, foxtrot) afterward in the Tibber App - TIA!

## WHY?!
Ford (Management) has decided to discontinue the API-Access for independent developers - so for now there is no way to get the state of charge (SOC) of your Ford electrical vehicle via code. This means that you can't configure any Ford vehicle with EVCC - which just SUCKS! Thanks Ford-Management! - just another coffin nail for the electric vehicle production in Colone, Germany.

There are some Apps/Service providers Ford still grants access to their API - Tibber is one of them. So this integration is digging "a tunnel" from Tibber to your Ford via Home Assistant, so that you can use the data in EVCC.

Sounds complicated? - Yes, it is! - But it works!

![BeispielAnsicht](/sample-view.png)

## Know Issues

- Tibber GraphAPI only update SOC and range (and all other date), if vehicle is actually connected & charging... yes this SUCKS! - _Tibber claims they are working on it..._
- EVCC charging status Code [A-F] are mainly guessed cause of inconsistent data from Tibber API
- Probably you can do way more via the GraphAPI from Tibber - but for now I am only interested in the electrical vehicle part 
- Probably very unstable - since it's the initial version

## Want to report an issue?

Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marq24/ha-tibber-graphapi/issues) for reporting any issues you encounter with this integration. Please be so kind before creating a new issues, check the closed ones, if your problem have been already reported (& solved). 

In order to speed up the support process you might like already prepare and provide DEBUG log output. In the case of a technical issue - like not-supported--yet-communication-mode - I would need this DEBUG log output to be able to help/fix the issue. There is a short [tutorial/guide 'How to provide DEBUG log' here](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/master/docs/HA_DEBUG.md) - please take the time to quickly go through it.

## Kudos

- all handcrafted / reverse engineered by painstakingly analyzing the Tibber App and the Tibber API 

## Setup / Installation

### Step I: Install the integration

#### Option 1: via HACS

- Install [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/)
- Add the custom integration repository to HACS: `https://github.com/marq24/ha-tibber-graphapi`
- Add integration repository (search for "Tibber GraphAPI" in "Explore & Download Repositories")
- Use the 3-dots at the right of the list entry (not at the top bar!) to download/install the custom integration - the latest release version is automatically selected. Only select a different version if you have specific reasons.
- After you presses download and the process has completed, you must __Restart Home Assistant__ to install all dependencies
- Setup the custom integration as described below (see _Step II: Adding or enabling the integration_)

#### Option 2: manual steps

- Copy all files from `custom_components/tibber_graphapi/` to `custom_components/tibber_graphapi/` inside your config Home Assistant directory.
- Restart Home Assistant to install all dependencies

### Step II: Adding or enabling the integration

__You must have installed the integration (manually or via HACS before)!__

#### Option 1: My Home Assistant (2021.3+)

Just click the following Button to start the configuration automatically (for the rest see _Option 2: Manually steps by step_):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=tibber_graphapi)

#### Option 2: Manually steps by step

Add custom integration using the web interface and follow instruction on screen.

- Go to `Configuration -> Integrations` and add "Tibber GraphAPI" integration
- Specify:
    - Provide display name for the device
    - Provide the username of your Tibber account
    - Provide the password of your Tibber account
    - OPTIONAL: Provide the vehicle index [if you have multiple vehicles in your tibber account]
    - Provide the update interval (can be 60 Seconds)
    - Provide area where the Tibber Pule Bridge is located

__IMPORTANT to know__: It can happen all types of errors - this is a quick hack build

## A Sample Vehicle EVCC-Configuration

### Required preparation

#### Create a Long-lived access token
You need a HA long-lived access token and the IP/hostname of your HA instance. For information how to create such a long-lived access token, please see my ['Use evcc with your Home Assistant sensor data' documentation](https://github.com/marq24/ha-evcc/blob/main/HA_AS_EVCC_SOURCE.md).

#### Required replacement in the following yaml example
Below you will find a valid evcc vehicle configuration - __but you have to make two replacements__:
1. The text '__[YOUR-HA-INSTANCE]__' have to be replaced with the IP/host name of your Home Assistant installation.

   E.g. when your HA is reachable via: http://192.168.10.20:8123, then you need to replaced `[YOUR-HA-INSTANCE]` with `192.168.10.20`


2. The text '__[YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]__' have to be replaced with the _Long-lived access token_ you have just created in HA.

   E.g. when your token is: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIzNWVjNzg5M2Y0ZjQ0MzBmYjUwOGEwMmU4N2Q0MzFmNyIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTUwNzYxMCwiZXhwIjoyMDMwODY3NjEwfQ.GMWO8saHpawkjNzk-uokxYeaP0GFKPQSeDoP3lCO488`, then you need to replaced `[YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]` with this (long) token text.

So as short example (with all replacements) would look like:

```
      ...
      source: http
      uri: http://192.168.10.20:8123/api/states/sensor.senec_grid_state_power
      method: GET
      headers:
        - Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIzNWVjNzg5M2Y0ZjQ0MzBmYjUwOGEwMmU4N2Q0MzFmNyIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTUwNzYxMCwiZXhwIjoyMDMwODY3NjEwfQ.GMWO8saHpawkjNzk-uokxYeaP0GFKPQSeDoP3lCO488
      insecure: true
      ...
```

### Finally, the sample evcc.yaml vehicle section for my Ford MachE

This is my evcc.config vehicle section for my Ford MachE - which is configured in Tibber as `Mustang Mach E` and so all sensors of this integration are prefixed with `mustang_mach_e_`:

```yaml
vehicles:
- name: ford_mach_e
  type: custom
  title: MachE GT-XXXXX
  capacity: 88.0
  soc:
    source: http
    uri: http://[YOUR-HA-INSTANCE]:8123/api/states/sensor.mustang_mach_e_soc
    method: GET
    headers:
      - Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]
      - Content-Taype: application/json
    insecure: true
    jq: .state | tonumber
    timeout: 2s # timeout in golang duration format, see https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration

  range:
    source: http
    uri: http://[YOUR-HA-INSTANCE]:8123/api/states/sensor.mustang_mach_e_range
    method: GET
    headers:
      - Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]
      - Content-Taype: application/json
    insecure: true
    jq: .state | tonumber
    timeout: 2s # timeout in golang duration format, see https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration

  status:
    source: http
    uri: http://[YOUR-HA-INSTANCE]/api/states/sensor.mustang_mach_e_evcc_charging_code
    method: GET
    headers:
      - Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-TOKEN-HERE]
      - Content-Taype: application/json
    insecure: true
    jq: .state
    timeout: 2s # timeout in golang duration format, see https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
```
